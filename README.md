### Open Source Simple Messaging

Open Source Simple Messaging is a platform that aims to remove the regulation and censorship surrounding public discussion.

We should be free to speak and express our thoughts without censorship. We don't deserve that, we are entitled to it by birthright.
Each and every one of us.

It's come to a stage where the bastion of free speech has now come under control and censor by governemental and corporate interests.
We are only permitted to comment on, watch and learn about information deemed 'safe' and the narrative is controlled from a powerbase
outside the influence of the everyday person.

We aim to give that control back, to enable anyone to share any discourse or open discussion with complete and full anonymity.

No email, no password, no IP logs, no personally identifiable information whatsoever is required to use the service.

The open nature of the block chain and public consensus ensure a free, unobstructed and uncorrupted platform which belongs to nobody.
